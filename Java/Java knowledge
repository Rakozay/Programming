Variables
	- State and behaviour

Primitive Data Types
	- int, double, float, short, char etc.

Arrays
	- Multidimensional arrays
		- Calculating length
		- Arraycopy

Operators
	- Compound assignments
	- Addition operator used for concatenating
	- Unary
		- The unary operators require only one operand; they perform various operations such as 		  incrementing/decrementing a value by one, negating an expression, or inverting the value 			  of a boolean.
	- Equality and Relational
	- Conditional 
		- ?-operator explained: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;
		  if someCodition is true assign value1 to result if not value2 to result
	- Bitwise and Bit shift

Expressions, statements, blocks
	- An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which 		  are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value. 
	- Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a 		  complete unit of execution
	- A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used 	 	   anywhere a single statement is allow

CFS (Control flow statements)
	- If-then, if-then-else (100%)
	- Switch statements
		- Switch blocks
	- Each break statement terminates the enclosing switch statement
	- While and do-while
	- For loops
		- Enhanced for statements
	- Branching statements
		- Labed and unlabeled breaks
		- Continue
		- Return

Classes and objects
	- Inheritance subclasses etc.
	- Class declaration extends, implements..
	- Variable declaration member variables
		- Member variables in a class equivalent to fields
		- Variables in a method equivalent to local variables
		- Parameters 
	- A method's method signature e.g. the signature for a method could be 
	  "calculateAnswer (double, int, double, double)" 
      where the double and int are primitive datatypes
